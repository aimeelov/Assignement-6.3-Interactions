# Assignment-6.3-Interactions

Use the Unity Physics Engine to create interaction between GameObjects.

Using what you have learned about rigidbodies, colliders, and triggers, jump back into Unity to add some interactions to your first-person player controller scene. Build both an opening door and a jump pad interaction: 

Rigidbody Component Overview - Parts 1 and 2
Working with Collisions and Triggers
Scripting with Forces and Torque
Once you have successfully integrated both a door opening interaction and a jump pad interaction into your scene, create and submit a screen recording that shows both of these interactions working properly when your first-person character controller approaches them.
